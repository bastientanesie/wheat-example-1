    <!--
      The source code of the webpage is read sequentially by the browser, line by line basically.
      Every time the browser hits a <script> or a <link>, it'll put that asset in a queue somewhere.
      Once the browser had reached the last line of this page, it'll start unstacking the assets in the queue:
      it'll start by downloading it and, if needed, process it. For a JS or CSS file, it means executing it.
      (you could go around that and tell him to download and process it asyncronously but it's way beyond the example)
      The browser goes one file at a time, so if a webpage has a lot of assets, that's what makes the
      "loading" state going for so long sometimes.
      So, since the header-script.js contains just an `window.alert()`, it'll be executed immediatly
      and the CSS will not be loaded yet, thus the page will look pretty blank ;-)
      The browser waits until you click "Ok" in the alert to resume the processing of your file, that's why
      the CSS won't load until you close the alert!

    <!--
      It's considered best practise to put your <link> tags in the <head>
      before your <script> tags (if you have any). That way, you make sure
      your webpage will look good before any JS is processed by the browser.

      Specifying `type="text/javascript"` and `charset="utf-8"` as I did in the <head>
      is not required nowadays since browsers are smart enough make it as default.
      But it costs nothing, and you're sure it'll be compatible with older browsers like IE -_-'...
